# SOC166 â€” Javascript Code Detected in Requested URL

## Executive Summary

On February 26, 2022, the Security Operations Center (SOC) detected and investigated a series of web attacks targeting **WebServer1002** (172.16.17.17). The attacks, originating from the external IP address **112.85.42.13**, were identified as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attempts. The attacker tried to inject malicious JavaScript code through a URL query parameter. Log analysis revealed that the web server consistently responded with an HTTP 302 redirect and a response size of zero, indicating that the malicious payloads were never processed or reflected back to a client. Threat intelligence confirmed the source IP has a history of malicious activity. The incident is classified as a **True Positive**, but the attack was **unsuccessful** and required no escalation.

## Incident Details

The initial alert was triggered by a suspicious URL request:

| **Date of Incident** | February 26, 2022 |
| **Source IP Address** | 112.85.42.13 |
| **Destination Host** | WebServer1002 (172.16.17.17) |
| **Attack Type** | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |
| **Malicious Payload** | `https://172.16.17.17/search/?q=<$script>javascript:$alert(1)<$/script>` |

## Investigation and Analysis

### 1. Initial Alert and Payload

The alert was triggered by a URL containing a clear attempt to inject JavaScript. The payload, `javascript:$alert(1)`, is a classic proof-of-concept used in XSS attacks. If successful, it would execute in a user's browser, demonstrating a vulnerability. The attacker used malformed tags (`<$script>`) in an attempt to bypass basic security filters.

### 2. Log Analysis

A review of the network logs for the source IP address revealed a pattern of repeated XSS attempts against the web server.

Several variations of the payload were observed across multiple log entries:

Crucially, the server's response to each of these malicious requests was an **HTTP Status Code 302 (Redirect)** with a **Response Size of 0**. This is key evidence that the attack failed for two reasons:
1.  **302 Redirect:** The server instructed the client to navigate to a different page *before* it processed and rendered the content containing the malicious payload. The XSS code was never in a position to be executed.
2.  **Zero Response Size:** A zero-byte response body confirms that no content, especially the attacker's injected script, was sent back to the client. For a reflected XSS attack to succeed, the malicious code must be "reflected" in the server's response.

### 3. Threat Intelligence

The source IP address `112.85.42.13` was analyzed using AbuseIPDB to assess its reputation. The platform confirmed that the IP has been reported multiple times for malicious activities.

This confirms the malicious intent of the traffic and that the attack was not an accidental or benign event.

## Skills and Tools Utilized

*   **Tools Used:** SIEM / Log Management, AbuseIPDB
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Web Attack Analysis (XSS), Log Correlation, HTTP Protocol Analysis, Threat Intelligence.

## Playbook Solution: Incident Classification

*   **Is the Traffic Malicious?** **Yes.** The traffic contained clear and repeated XSS payloads.
*   **What Is the Attack Type?** **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).**
*   **Was the Attack Successful?** **No.** The server's redirect mechanism and zero-byte response prevented the malicious script from being executed.
*   **Do You Need Tier 2 Escalation?** **No.** The attack was automatically thwarted by the server's configuration, and no compromise occurred.
*   **Incident Classification:** **True Positive.** The alert correctly identified a genuine web attack attempt.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The alert for SOC166 was a **true positive** for a series of attempted XSS attacks originating from a known malicious IP address. The investigation confirmed that the web application's configuration, which issued a redirect in response to the malformed requests, effectively neutralized the threat. The attack was unsuccessful, and no systems were compromised.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Acknowledge Prevention:** Note the successful prevention of the attack by the current server configuration. This behavior should be confirmed as an intended security feature.
2.  **Block Malicious IP:** Add the source IP address `112.85.42.13` to the network firewall's blocklist to prevent any further attempts from this actor.
3.  **Review WAF Rules:** While the attack failed, it provides an opportunity to ensure that the Web Application Firewall (WAF) has specific rules in place to detect and block XSS patterns proactively.
