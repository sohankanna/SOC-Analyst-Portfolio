# SOC111 - Traffic to Malware Domain (Event ID:42)

## Executive Summary

On January 30, 2021, the Security Operations Center (SOC) received an alert for traffic to a known malware domain originating from the host **BellaPRD** (172.16.17.19). The investigation confirmed that the user `Bella` attempted to access the URL `http://casinos-hub.com/s/ZQhDyLF/`. Threat intelligence analysis from VirusTotal confirmed the domain is malicious and associated with phishing and malware distribution. The corporate web proxy or security gateway successfully identified the threat, and the **Device Action** was **Blocked**. This is a **True Positive** for a real threat, but the attack was **unsuccessful** as the connection was prevented.

## Incident Details

The initial alert was triggered by an outbound connection to a domain on a threat intelligence blocklist:

## Investigation and Analysis

### 1. Alert Context and Threat Intelligence

The alert `SOC111 - Traffic to Malware Domain` is a high-confidence indicator that a user or process attempted to connect to a server known to be malicious.
*   **Threat Intelligence (VirusTotal):** A check on the destination domain `casinos-hub.com` confirmed its malicious reputation, with **9 security vendors** flagging it for malware and phishing. This validates the alert's premise that the destination was hostile.

### 2. Log Analysis and Confirmation of Prevention

The investigation focused on confirming the activity and, most importantly, the outcome.
*   **Log Confirmation:** A review of the proxy logs confirms that the user's `chrome.exe` process made a GET request for the malicious URL.

*   **Prevention (The "Smoking Gun"):** The **`Device Action: Blocked`** status, present in both the SIEM alert and the detailed log, is the definitive piece of evidence. This proves that the corporate web security gateway functioned correctly, identified the destination as malicious, and blocked the connection. The user's browser never successfully loaded the malicious page, and no compromise occurred.

### 3. Final Assessment

The evidence confirms this was a benign event in terms of impact, but a notable one in terms of user behavior. The security controls worked as intended, but the user's attempt to access a gambling-related site, which is often a vector for malware, is a policy and security awareness issue.

## Skills and Tools Utilized

*   **Tools Used:** SIEM, Proxy Logs, VirusTotal
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Triage, Threat Intelligence Correlation, Security Control Validation.

## Playbook Solution: Incident Classification

*   **Analyze URL:** **Malicious.** The URL and domain are flagged by multiple TI vendors.
*   **Was the Attack Successful?** **No.** The connection was blocked by the web proxy.
*   **Do You Need Tier 2 Escalation?** **No.** The threat was successfully neutralized by an automated control.
*   **Incident Classification:** **True Positive.** (The alert correctly identified an attempted connection to a malicious domain).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The alert for SOC111 was a **true positive**. A user attempted to access a known malicious website. The investigation confirms the malicious nature of the destination but, most importantly, confirms that the connection was successfully **blocked** by the web proxy. No systems were compromised.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Acknowledge Prevention:** Note the successful prevention by the web security gateway.
2.  **Close Alert:** The alert can be closed as a True Positive, with the outcome noted as "Blocked" or "Prevented."
3.  **Policy Violation / User Awareness:** The user `Bella` attempted to access a non-work-related site that is a known vector for malware. This constitutes a violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.
    *   The user's manager should be notified of the activity.
    *   The user `Bella` should be reminded of the Acceptable Use Policy and may need to be enrolled in remedial security awareness training.
4.  **Verify Block Rules:** Ensure the domain `casinos-hub.com` and IP `45.80.181.51` are permanently on the web filter's blocklist.
