# SOC-Analyst-Portfolio

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of over 100 hands-on security alert investigations conducted on the [LetsDefend.io](https://letsdefend.io/) platform. This project is designed to demonstrate my practical skills in a simulated, enterprise-grade Security Operations Center (SOC) environment, showcasing an end-to-end incident analysis workflow.

## About The Platform

LetsDefend.io is a hands-on training platform that provides realistic SOC alerts and the tools necessary to investigate them, including a SIEM, EDR, email security gateway, and log management capabilities. Each investigation in this repository is a real case file from the platform.

## Project Structure

The investigations are organized into folders based on the primary alert category or attack type, mirroring a real-world incident tracking system. This demonstrates the ability to identify and classify a wide range of security threats, including:

-   **Malware:** Infections from known families like Emotet, Agent Tesla, and Quasar RAT.
-   **WebAttack:** SQL Injection, LFI, and exploitation of web vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-46214).
-   **LOLBin:** Malicious use of legitimate system binaries like `certutil.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and `wscript.exe`.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** Analysis of exploits like JuicyPotato and CVE-2024-49138.
-   **Phishing:** Triage of various phishing techniques, including credential harvesters, malicious attachments, and "Quishing" (QR Code Phishing).
-   **Brute Force:** Detection of successful and unsuccessful brute-force attacks against RDP and VPN services.
-   **And many more...**

## Achievements & Milestones

This project represents a significant volume of completed investigations. My consistent effort and progress on the LetsDefend platform have been recognized with the following milestones:

## Skills Demonstrated

This collection of case files showcases proficiency in the core competencies of a SOC Analyst:

-   **Incident Triage:** Rapidly assessing alerts to determine severity, scope, and validity (True Positive vs. False Positive).
-   **Log Analysis:** Correlating data from multiple sources (SIEM, EDR, Firewall, Web Proxy, Windows Event Logs) to reconstruct an attack chain.
-   **Malware Analysis:** Performing static and dynamic analysis of malicious files (executables, scripts, documents) to understand their behavior and purpose.
-   **Threat Intelligence Correlation:** Using external tools (VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, AbuseIPDB) and internal TI to enrich alerts and confirm indicators of compromise (IOCs).
-   **TTP Recognition:** Identifying attacker techniques, tactics, and procedures that map to frameworks like the MITRE ATT&CK®.
-   **Technical Documentation:** Authoring clear, concise, and actionable incident reports suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
-   **Remediation & Response:** Providing concrete, actionable recommendations for containment, eradication, and recovery.

## Tools Utilized

The investigations in this portfolio involved the use of a simulated security stack and external research tools, including:

-   **SIEM & Log Management:** Analyzing and querying logs to find evidence of malicious activity.
-   **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR):** Reviewing process trees, command-line arguments, and network connections.
-   **Threat Intelligence Platforms:** VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, AbuseIPDB.
-   **Analysis Tools:** CyberChef (for deobfuscation), static analysis of scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, Python).

## My Investigation Workflow

Each incident in this portfolio follows a structured, repeatable workflow to ensure thoroughness and accuracy:

1.  **Alert Triage:** Review the initial alert to understand the trigger and key entities involved.
2.  **Threat Intelligence Enrichment:** Check all IOCs (hashes, IPs, domains) against external TI sources.
3.  **Log Correlation:** Dive deep into EDR, network, and application logs to reconstruct the timeline of events.
4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine the initial access vector and the full scope of the compromise.
5.  **Documentation:** Write a detailed incident report summarizing the findings, confirming the outcome (successful/unsuccessful), and providing actionable recommendations.
