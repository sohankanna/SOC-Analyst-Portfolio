# SOC104: Analysis of a Suspected Malware Alert

## Executive Summary

On March 21, 2021, the Security Operations Center (SOC) investigated a SIEM alert for a file named **winrar600.exe** on the host **SusieHost**. The file's hash (**c74862e16bcc2b0e02cadb7ab14e3cd6**) showed a low detection rate on VirusTotal but was flagged as malicious in the AnyRun sandbox. A detailed behavioral analysis was conducted to understand the context of its actions. While the program performed several actions that could be interpreted as malicious (such as creating scheduled tasks and reading browser settings), these actions also have plausible benign explanations. Critically, the analysis confirmed the absence of any command-and-control (C2) network communication. Based on this evidence, the file's activity is assessed to be non-malicious, and the alert is classified as a **False Positive**.

## Incident Details

The initial alert was triggered in the SIEM dashboard:

| **Date of Incident** | March 21, 2021 |
| **Source Host** | SusieHost |
| **File Name** | winrar600.exe |
| **File Hash (MD5)** | c74862e16bcc2b0e02cadb7ab14e3cd6 |
| **Destination Host** | N/A (Local Execution) |

## Investigation and Analysis

### 1. Initial Triage & Threat Intelligence

The investigation began by checking the file's MD5 hash against public threat intelligence databases.

*   **VirusTotal:** The hash showed a very low detection rate, with only **1 vendor** flagging it as malicious.

*   **AnyRun Sandbox:** To be sure, the file was also checked in AnyRun. The sandbox returned a "Malicious" verdict from multiple detection engines.

### 2. Behavioral Analysis

Given the conflicting threat intelligence, a deeper analysis of the file's behavior in the sandbox was necessary. The processes `winrar600.exe` and `Uninstall.exe` were flagged.

The analysis revealed four key actions performed by the process:

Each action was evaluated for both benign and malicious possibilities:

| Action | Benign Reason | Malicious Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Creates a software uninstall entry** | Standard procedure for legitimate software to allow for easy removal via the control panel. | Malware and PUPs often do this to appear legitimate and blend in. |
| **2. Searches for installed software** | A program might perform compatibility checks or function as a software updater. | A common reconnaissance step for malware to find security software to disable or vulnerable apps to exploit. |
| **3. Reads Security Settings of Internet Explorer** | A rare but possible action for a legacy application that needs specific security configurations to function. | Highly suspicious behavior used by malware to identify weaknesses for exploitation or browser hijacking. |
| **4. Creates/Modifies COM Task Schedule Object**| A legitimate method used by applications like Google Chrome for automatic updates or background tasks. | One of the most common methods for malware to achieve persistence, ensuring it runs again after a reboot. |

### 3. Network Activity

The AnyRun sandbox report was checked for any external network connections. It was confirmed that **no C2 server has been contacted**. This is a critical piece of evidence. The absence of C2 communication significantly lowers the likelihood that this file is part of a botnet or a remote access trojan.

## Skills and Tools Utilized

*   **Tools Used:** SIEM, VirusTotal, AnyRun (Sandbox)
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Threat Intelligence Analysis, Sandboxing, Behavioral Analysis, Incident Triage.

## Playbook Solution: Incident Classification

*   **Is the File Malicious?** **No.** Despite being flagged by the sandbox, its actions have plausible benign explanations, and the lack of C2 communication is a key indicator that it is not malware.
*   **What Is the Attack Type?** **N/A (False Positive).**
*   **Was the Attack Successful?** **N/A.** The executed program's activity was determined to be non-malicious.
*   **Do You Need Tier 2 Escalation?** **No.** The alert has been fully investigated and determined to be a false positive.
*   **Incident Classification:** **False Positive.** The SIEM alert was triggered by a legitimate, albeit unusually behaving, application.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The alert for `winrar600.exe` has been investigated and is determined to be a **false positive**. While dynamic analysis in the sandbox initially flagged the file as malicious due to a combination of suspicious-looking behaviors, a deeper analysis reveals that each action has a potential benign purpose. The definitive factor in this analysis is the complete lack of network traffic to a C2 server, which leads to the conclusion that this file is not a malware.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Close Alert:** The security alert should be closed as a False Positive.
2.  **Whitelist Hash (Optional):** If this software is expected in the environment, consider adding the MD5 hash `c74862e16bcc2b0e02cadb7ab14e3cd6` to an allowlist to prevent future unnecessary alerts.
