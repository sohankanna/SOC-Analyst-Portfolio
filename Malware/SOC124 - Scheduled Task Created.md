# SOC124 - Scheduled Task Created


## Executive Summary

On February 14, 2021, the Security Operations Center (SOC) received an alert for a new scheduled task created by the file `GoogleUpdate.exe` on the host **Maxim** (172.16.17.83). The alert was triggered because scheduled task creation is a common persistence technique used by malware. However, a thorough investigation confirmed that the file in question is the legitimate, signed Google Update service executable. Analysis of its behavior and threat intelligence reputation shows the activity is benign and consistent with its intended purpose of keeping Google software updated. The antivirus software **Blocked** the action, indicating a false positive detection. The alert is therefore classified as a **False Positive**.

## Incident Details

The initial alert was triggered by a legitimate application performing a behavior often associated with malware:

## Investigation and Analysis

### 1. Alert Context: Scheduled Tasks as a Persistence TTP

The rule `SOC124 - Scheduled Task Created` is designed to detect a common persistence technique used by attackers. By creating a scheduled task, malware can ensure it re-executes automatically at set intervals or upon system startup, surviving reboots. Many legitimate updaters and system tools also use this functionality, creating a potential for behavioral rules to generate false positives.

### 2. File Analysis and Threat Intelligence

The investigation focused on verifying the legitimacy of the `GoogleUpdate.exe` file.
*   **VirusTotal:** The file hash showed **zero detections** from all security vendors and was correctly identified as the legitimate Google Update executable.

*   **Hybrid Analysis:** The file was completely whitelisted, further confirming its benign nature.

*   **Any.Run:** While Any.Run flagged the sample as malicious, this is likely due to its sensitive behavioral engine detecting the scheduled task creation itself, rather than any inherently malicious code. The spawned processes (`SLUI.exe`, `SppExtComObj.exe`) are legitimate Windows components related to software licensing and activation, which the updater may interact with.

### 3. Confirmation of Prevention and Final Assessment

The alert details clearly state `Device Action: Blocked`. This means the antivirus or EDR agent on the host prevented the scheduled task from being created. While this action was based on a false positive detection, it confirms that security controls did respond to the suspicious behavior. Given that the file is legitimate and its purpose is to create scheduled tasks for software updates, the alert is definitively a false positive.

## Skills and Tools Utilized

*   **Tools Used:** SIEM, EDR, VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, Any.Run
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** False Positive Analysis, Persistence Technique Triage, Threat Intelligence Correlation.

## Playbook Solution: Incident Classification

*   **Analyze Malware:** **Non-malicious.** The file is the legitimate Google Update service.
*   **Was Malware Quarantined/Cleaned?** **Yes.** The action was "Blocked," which implies the process was stopped and likely quarantined.
*   **Incident Classification:** **False Positive.**

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The alert for SOC124 was a **false positive**. The EDR/antivirus agent incorrectly flagged the legitimate `GoogleUpdate.exe` process because its normal behavior—creating a scheduled task for updates—is also a technique used by malware. The investigation confirms the file is benign, and no malicious activity occurred.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Close Alert:** The alert should be closed as a False Positive.
2.  **Release from Quarantine:** The legitimate `GoogleUpdate.exe` file should be released from quarantine on the host "Maxim" to ensure Google products (like Chrome) receive important security updates.
3.  **Rule Tuning / Whitelisting:** To prevent future false positives, an exception should be created in the EDR/antivirus policy. This exception should specifically allow the file with hash `82f657b0aee67a6a560321cf0927f9f7` (or, more broadly, any file signed by Google LLC) to create scheduled tasks.
