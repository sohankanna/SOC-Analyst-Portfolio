We get an alert from the SIEM dashboard as shown

We get the MD5 hash value of the file as

0b486fe0503524cfe4726a4022fa6a68

Using this we can search on VirusTotal which gives us the following results

The file seems to be indeed malicious in nature, we can also check what network actions it performs by going into the Relations Tab

We can use this to check if the file has contacted any C2 server from our victim’s computer which in this case is “MarkPRD” (172.16.17.88)

Looks like it hasn’t contacted any. Let us take this further and check with the same MD5 hash in AnyRun as well. Doing so gives us the result

Clicking on the first report we get this

The file in question is the **ab.bin.exe**. Clicking on it we can get some more extra information as to why it was detected as a ransomware.

We have two takeaways from this

1. **Classic Ransomware Behavior:**

- **T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact:** This is a direct reference to the MITRE ATT&CK framework technique for ransomware. The note “**Renames files like ransomware**” confirms it’s actively encrypting user data.
- **T1490 Inhibit System Recovery:** The malware is trying to prevent the user from recovering their files. The specific action noted is “**Deletes shadow copies**,” a common tactic used by ransomware to make it impossible to restore files using Windows’ built-in recovery features.

**2. Other Malicious Activities:**

- **T1562.001 Disable or Modify Tools:** It’s attempting to bypass security measures by modifying **UAC/LUA settings** (User Account Control). This allows the malware to perform actions with higher privileges without prompting the user.
- **XORed URL has been found (YARA):** The malware contains a hidden (obfuscated) URL. This is likely the address of its command-and-control (C2) server, which it uses to receive instructions or send back information (like encryption keys).

So clearly this is indeed a ransomware and a True Positive. It is part of the Avaddon family of Malware. This [report](https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/avaddon/) gives further information on this. You can use this article to solve the playbook questions as needed. Thanks for reading!
